# Yodl Webhooks Example

This repository serves as a template for Yodl mini-app (yapp) builders to implement webhook verification and payment validation. It demonstrates how to securely receive webhooks from Yodl and validate payments using the Yodl indexer API.

## Features

- üîê Webhook signature verification
- üí∞ Payment validation against expected parameters
- üõ°Ô∏è Type-safe Express.js implementation
- üåê ENS resolution for production signing address

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Yodl signing address (provided on request by Yodl team)

## Environment Variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the following variables:

- `YODL_SIGNING_ADDRESS`: Required in development mode. The address used to verify webhook signatures.
- `YODL_SIGNING_KEY`: Only used for running test scripts locally.
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'development' for local testing, 'production' for production use.

Note: In production, the signing address is automatically resolved from the ENS name `webhooks.yodl.eth`. In development, it uses the address from `YODL_SIGNING_ADDRESS` environment variable.

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

## Run development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Run production server

```bash
yarn start
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Webhook Verification

```http
POST /api/webhook
```

Receives and verifies webhooks from Yodl. The webhook payload includes:

- `txHash`: Transaction hash
- `chainId`: Chain ID
- `paymentIndex`: Index of the payment in the transaction

**Headers:**

- `x-yodl-signature`: Signature of the webhook payload

### 2. Payment Validation

```http
POST /api/validate-payment
```

Validates a payment against expected parameters.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "txHash": "0x...",
  "paymentIndex": 0,
  "acceptedTokens": ["USDC", "USDT"],
  "expectedAmount": 1000000
}
```

## Test Scripts

The `src/test` directory contains standalone TypeScript scripts for testing various functionalities. These are not powered by Jest or other test runners, but rather are simple scripts that can be run directly.

To run a test script:

```bash
npx tsx src/test/<script-name>.ts
```

Available test scripts:

- `getYodlSigningAddress.test.ts`: Tests ENS resolution and caching for the Yodl signing address
- `webhook.test.ts`: Tests webhook signature generation and verification
- `payment-validation.test.ts`: Tests payment validation logic

## Usage Example

1. **Receiving Webhooks**

When Yodl sends a webhook to your endpoint, it will include a signature in the `x-yodl-signature` header. The template automatically verifies this signature against your Yodl signing address.

2. **Validating Payments**

After receiving a webhook, you can validate the payment using the validate-payment endpoint:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/validate-payment', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    txHash: '0x...',
    paymentIndex: 0,
    acceptedTokens: ['USDC'],
    expectedAmount: 1000000,
  }),
});
```

## Security Considerations

1. Always verify webhook signatures using the provided `x-yodl-signature` header
2. In development, store your Yodl signing address securely in environment variables
3. In production, the signing address is automatically resolved from ENS
4. Validate all payment parameters before processing
5. Use HTTPS in production
